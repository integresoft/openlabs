    <h1>WHAT IS OPENLABS?</h1>
    <p>We are OPENLABS - But what does that mean? Are we a technology group? A research group? Some random group on the internet? 
      In reality, we are a mixture of these. To some, we are a platform for innovation, sparking the minds of our peers. 
      To some others, we are simply a tool, used to find information about subjects. We strive to make our content top-tier and accessible to everyone.

      <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
      <p style="font-size:17px;">Openlabs was officially started in April of 2023, under the name of the Classen Research Institute. 
        See, at the time, I had moved from my old school to the Classen Middle School of Advanced Studies, which was intended to be the primary audience for Openlabs, for my seventh grade year. 
        And, as of the time of writing this, I have never actually spent a day there yet. But that’s not what’s important. I gathered with my friend, Collin, and we started thinking about how this could work. 
        At first, I just wanted it to be a simple repository for people to upload stories and research papers, but after talking with Collin, we realized that there was so much more potential. 
        What if people could upload photos and videos? What if people could share announcements and send messages? 
        The possibilities were endless, but considering the resources available, we started doing what we could.

      <h1>HISTORY</h1>
      <p>Using my coding skills, I developed a website using HTML and CSS. It was pretty basic, but it worked for what we needed it to do. 
        It had four sections: Home, Research, Contribute, and About, just like the modern website. Meanwhile, Collin was thinking of what he could do. 
        He wasn’t good at backend development, and strongly resented writing articles and research papers. As of now, he still is thinking about an assignment for Openlabs. 
        The project was slightly halted following the end of the sixth grade year, but after further thought, I had started again, 
        first by remodeling the website that I had made previously.
<br><br>
        However, this dream of “a place for sharing information and knowledge” didn’t start at Openlabs. 
        In January of 2023, me and my friend, Max, started an idea for a platform called Neurogen. Along with Collin, again, we started planning for this hypothetical platform. 
        It started when me and my friends had developed a study method on IXL. It involved a lot of psychology, but proved to be extremely effective. 
        We had wanted to share this idea with our classmates, and had decided to hold a live meeting on the internet at the public library. 
        However, poor planning and a lack of resources resulted in it being unsuccessful. Afterwards, we decided that it wouldn’t be best to continue, 
        and Neurogen was to be abandoned before it even took off.

      <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
      <p>
        Now it’s to the part about what we actually do. Unfortunately, there is no direct answer to this question. 
        Generally, though, Openlabs is a platform where students, preferably from Classen SAS, can upload their academic papers for others to see and use. 
        Similar to Wikipedia, anyone with experience can upload articles, as long as they follow certain criteria and standards. 
        The topics of the articles that are recommended include academics, such as mathematics, English, science, and social studies/history. 
        However, anyone with sufficient experience in the subject can upload content related to other topics, such as extracurriculars or organized opinions. 
        At Openlabs, we strive to keep our user base as happy as possible, so we try to make sure that the articles that are published are well-written and unoffensive. 
        <br><br>
        People that are interested in starting with Openlabs can apply with the form <a href="contribute.html">here</a>.
        Once they do, they’ll be sent an email from a representative, probably from me, about instructions for what to do next. 
        If it’s for academic papers, the author of the paper would send a copy of the document to a representative, where it would be edited and published. 
        If the article was considered offensive, unclear, or otherwise inadequate to publish, it would be sent back and politely denied. 
        For content besides academic papers, case-specific instructions may be sent about how to continue.

      <h1>ORGANIZATION TRANSPARENCY</h1>
      <p>We are a transparent organization. This means that we listen to our users and writers and we make sure that Openlabs best suits their needs. 
        It also means that we tell our user base about what’s happening, and we let them have representations in major decisions. 
        We do this because we want our platform to reach the clouds, and such a goal would only be possible when we listen to our academic community and when we let them 
        guide us to our general goals. We take pride in knowing that our community is what makes us exist, and we can’t thank everyone enough.
<br><br>
        Right now, we are trying to promote the use of Openlabs and are primarily trying to gain a following in Classen SAS, which again, is our primary audience. 
        Plans are already being made for how to share Openlabs and how we can get people engaged. As well as that, we are working behind the scenes to develop our platform and 
        make sure it’s optimal for use. Experimental development is currently underway for new, special features that are expected to come along with the support from this 
        community. Either way, we believe that we are at our optimal peak, and will only get better over time.

      <p>Again, we are Openlabs. We are an organization simply trying to create a new source for schoolwork, connection, inspiration, and support for our supporters. 
        <br>
        "I have a mission, a mission to provide the students of the Classen Middle School of Advanced Students a place for scientific inspiration and for the connections of the 
        students through academics through academic and collaborative research. This is the mission, heart, and soul of Openlabs."<br>
