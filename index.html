            <p style="font-size:17px;">
                The nervous system is the body system that is responsible for the communication and
processing of human sensory information, and is responsible for responding to these
messages. The nervous system allows communication between the different parts of the
body and between major body organs, allowing the control of the body and reception of
information. Sensory receptors in the senses send messages to the brain, which can then
process the information and could possibly send a response back into the body.

                    <p>When, running for president in 1960, John F. Kennedy chose as his campaign slogan “it’s time to get this country moving again,” few Americans imagined that if elected, he would so pick up the pace that he’d take them to the moon. Just three months into his presidency, Kennedy pledged, prophetically, in his address to Congress on May 25th, 1961, “that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.” To which he added, “No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.”

                  <h1>About OPENLABS</h1>
        <p>We are OPENLABS. But in reality, we are really just a couple
            kids with a mission. A mission to provide readily-available, open-source, reliable 
            information about topics important to academics, and topics for general self-help and 
            self-development. The website is a place to share ideas, works, articles, artwork, 
            research, music, and creations. We work in collaboration with our community members
            to give an unbiased option of information - a neutral opinion. This is our goal, our
            mission, and our livelihood.
<br><br>
            We reccomend that you contribute to our cause for freedom of expression. Work to share ideas, articles,
            research, art, and announcements. Our research and our foundation are built from the
            hard work of our community members. Without our community, we would not be able to
            sustain our research and our goal. People like you keep our projects alive. Please,
            consider sharing your achivements with people you know.

        <div class="description" style="float:left;width:40%;">
           <p style="float:left; font-size:18px;">Hey, I’m Trevor, the founder of Openlabs. I started Openlabs with the idea as a repository for sharing research papers, photo/video, artwork and other forms of media production. 
          I got the idea from realizing something - we create a lot of research papers at school. Why not make it publicly accessible to anyone that wants to read it? While we’re at it, 
          why not let them upload photos, videos, and whatnot? Along with my transition to the Classen School of Advanced Studies Middle School, 
          this spark of motivation inspired me to create a website using HTML to share my work as well as the work of others.
<br><br>
           Along with my friend, Collin, we started experimenting, thinking about a way this could work. It started being called the Classen Research Institute, 
           but was changed after I realized that it sounded too professional, like an actual institute of research. I found a good name using the internet - Openlabs. 
           It represents what we do perfectly. We are a safe place for collaboration and connection between students, and a place to get recognition and to share updates. 
           This is my only goal, and I believe that with the cooperation of my peers, the dream of Openlabs can reach the skies.
