  <h1>Before you start, make sure to read these guidelines:</h1>
  <p>We can't stress enough how important it is to share appropriate and well-crafted content on our platform. 
    Think of it as the glue that connects our community, just like how soda is nothing without sugar! When you upload content that's on point and well-written, it's like adding a splash of color to our canvas. 
    It makes the whole experience more enjoyable and meaningful for everyone involved. By keeping things respectful, accurate, and engaging, we create a space that's welcoming and better for everyone. 
    So, let's be ready, ensuring that the content we share is the best possible and adds a spark of brilliance to our platform, igniting conversations and inspiring others.</p>
    <li>Content should be relevant to the platform's purpose.</li>
    <p>Make sure that the content you share follows with the theme and purpose of the platform. 
    Remeber the interests and expectations of the target audience, and make it possible for others to engage in it. 
      Irrelevant papers could confuse people, so it's important to stay focused and provide value within the platform's scope.</p>
    <li>Along with content relevancy, Make sure that the content is respectful and inclusive, and that it promotes positive interactions with your audience.</li>
    <p>Promote a welcoming environment by accounting for diverse viewpoints and make sure that they have representation. 
       Offensive or discriminatory language could tarnish our platform, and here we strive to have a sense of belonging for all users. However, this doesn't include sensitive topics, where in such instances
      certain content that violates certain viewpoints may still be accepted, as long as other certain requirements are met.</p>
    <li>Use clear language to connect with your audience, and ensure that your content has a high standard of grammar, spelling, and punctuation, and fact-check any statements.</li>
    <p>We recommend that you use language that is easily comprehensible, as most of our audience are not adults. Your ideas should be conveyed
      in a straightforward manner to better connect with said audience. 
      Additionally, it would be necessary to avoid technical terms unless necessary.
      Along with that, you should cite credible sources and fact-check any claims or statements before the content goes live. Imagine if you made an incorrect statement,
      but you already published your article, so everyone believed false information? A big part of our platform is being
       transparent and honest with your audience to establish trust and credibility with yourself and the platform.
     This helps to ensure that your content is clear, professional, and free from errors. 
      </p>
    <li>Make sure your content allows for an supportive environment and that encouraging thoughtful discussions and feedback.</li>
    <p> Foster a community of meaningful interactions by encouraging thoughtful discussions and providing constructive feedback. 
      Engage with your audience, address their comments or questions, and encourage them to share their thoughts and experiences. 
      Encourage an atmosphere of respect and support to create a positive and collaborative environment.</p>

    <p>Despite what it sounds like, we're really not that formal. We're just trying to make sure that our researchers and users stay positively engaged with our platform.</p>
